<span class="bodhi m-text">On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in the Eastern Park in the Mansion of Migāra’s Mother together with a great Saṅgha of bhikkhus, with five hundred bhikkhus, all of them arahants.</span><br />
<span class="sujato m-text">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother, together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred monks, all of whom were perfected ones.</span><br />
