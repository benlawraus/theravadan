<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>To create a website with no javascript. This was achieved in a manner of speaking...</p>
</section>
<section id="why">
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>For low maintenance and low overhead on server and browser leading to hopefully quicker
access times. Also to allow people to download the entire website and either browse locally
or use file search.</p>
</section>
<section id="strictly-speaking">
<h3>Strictly Speaking...</h3>
<p>All the pages are served statically,
meaning that the webpages, as seen in the browser, are located in individual,
self-contained files on a server.</p>
<p>The only exception is the search page which uses <a href="https://anvil.works">anvilworks</a> a regime of creating websites
with only python. Strictly speaking, the search page contains mechanisms to interpret
the python code into javascript.</p>
</section>
<section id="sutta-central">
<h3>Sutta Central</h3>
<p><a href="https://lokanta.github.io">Bhikkhu Sujato</a> has worked hard to bring the pāli texts to a global
audience with his website <a href="https://suttacentral.net">suttacentral</a>. Other pāli scholars
and Buddhist monks have since joined him and also placed their translation work on
<a href="https://github.com/suttacentral/bilara-data">bilara</a>.</p>
<p>This website used those translations to create a static website with keyword search.</p>
<p>It is not meant
to replace <a href="https://suttacentral.net">suttacentral</a> and it cannot, <a href="https://suttacentral.net">suttacentral</a> is complete.
But the words of Lord Buddha are valuable and so are the
translations. To place another copy of these words on the internet hopefully will increase the odds
of them being discovered.</p>
</section>
<section id="technical">
<h3>Technical</h3>
<p>The pāli texts and translations take currently around 700,000 lines of text. These are divided into
small units called sutta that can be served individually from one html file.</p>
<p>A small python program was used to convert the json formatted files on <a href="https://github.com/suttacentral/bilara-data">bilara</a> into a mark-up
language called <a href="https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html">restructuredText</a>
for easier editing and formatting.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html">restructuredText</a> files are then converted into html files using
<a href="https://blog.getpelican.com">pelican</a> and uploaded to a static hosting company.</p>
<section id="search">
<h4>Search</h4>
<p>With no javascript and no code running on a  server anywhere, creating a search function is
problematic. The solution was to use a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org">postgresql</a> database which
has state-of-the-art text search capabilities. Fortunately, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org">postgresql</a> search is easy to implement
without much investment.</p>
<p><a href="https://postgrest.org/en/stable/">postgrest</a> was then used for interface between the database and web
using a REST API.</p>
<p>Lastly, the search page. It is simple enough, only one input box. Use javascript? Well... this website's
IT already had an account on <a href="https://anvil.works">anvilworks</a> so that seemed an easier route...</p>
<p>To allow the reader to search, there has to be a page that queries the database and places the
research results into a formatted page. Using only python on <a href="https://anvil.works">anvilworks</a> was an easy implementation.
Probably in the future, the search page will be programmed with javascript alone.</p>
