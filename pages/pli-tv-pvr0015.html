<span class="brahmali m-text">When a monk who is involved in a conflict is speaking in the Sangha, he should know the actions that are the bases for offenses, as well as the failures, the offenses, the origin stories, the attributes, the sequence, what has and has not been done, the legal procedures, the legal issues, and their settling. He should not be swayed by desire, ill will, confusion or fear. He should persuade when persuasion is appropriate, should make others understand when making understand is appropriate, should look on when looking on is appropriate, and should inspire when inspiration is appropriate. Thinking, “I have obtained a faction,” he should not despise the factions of others. Thinking, “I am learned,” he should not despise those who are ignorant. Thinking, “I am more senior,” he should not despise those who are junior. He should not speak about what has not been reached, and he should not, based on the Teaching and the Monastic Law, neglect what has been reached. He should resolve that legal issue in accordance with the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction.</span><br />
